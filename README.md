# Field-Oriented-Control-FOC---FPGA

As a extention of the thesis project, FOC function was not able to implement on a hardware due to kinds of reason, so that the main branch of this resposrty is continue public implementation of FOC on hardware in Github.

The main controller probably operating on a FPGA or a Microcontroller STM32 series, combines with three-phase two-level inverter driver which design in Altium designer and implement on PCB layout. In result,the brench including FPGA or MCU programming of the control system, and the hardware designing composed of schematic and pcb layout.
